 * An asynchronous host object proxy. Host objects added via CoreWebView2.AddHostObjectToScript
 * are exposed as host object proxies using window.chrome.webview.hostObjects.{name}. Host object
 * proxies are promises, and resolve to an object representing the host object. The promise is
 * rejected if the app has not added an object with the name. When JavaScript code access a
 * property or method of the object, a promise is returned. The promise resolves to the value
 * that's returned from the host for the property or method. The promise is rejected in case of
 * error; for example, no property or method on the object, or parameters are not valid.
 *
 * Host object proxies are JavaScript Proxy objects that intercept all property get, property set,
 * and method invocations. Properties or methods that are a part of the Function or Object
 * prototype are run in the JavaScript engine of the current document. Additionally any property
 * or method in the chrome.webview.hostObjects.options.forceLocalProperties array are also run
 * in the JavaScript engine of the current document. This defaults to including optional methods
 * that have meaning in JavaScript like toJSON and Symbol.toPrimitive. Add more to the array as
