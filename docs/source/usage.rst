Using Otomad Helper
-------------------

Using Otomad Helper is pretty straightforward from here. Here’s how to use it.

- You *import and use a MIDI file to configure and generate the clips you want*. You should use a MIDI which **created by yourself** and not someone else. It’s discourteous. Don’t create YTPMIDIs/OTOMIDIs or any form of remix you didn’t create.
- You need to *have a clip selected in the timeline* in order to generate anything from the MIDI onto Vegas Pro.

  - Alternatively, you can use a clip or source from your computer to be used for generating the MIDI.

- The Audio and Video tabs will allow you to edit the settings of how the clips are generated, there is a variety of settings, play with them and tweak them to sort your needs for the start of your creation.
- There is also a variety of tools to help work on the most ludicrous of tasks for your projects, making the chore of editing certain clips to applying different effects easier said than done.
